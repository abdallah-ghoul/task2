<p>i don't know if this is known about me but,i'm what you would call a foodie so here is
     a small list of food i really love</p>

     <ol> 
        <li> pizza </li> 
        <P> you really can't convince me that there is some one out there who hates pizza i mean 
            you could do what ever you want with it you can add any thing everthing to a pizza and it would only taste better
             
            
            quick note : just don't add pineapple on top of it we really don't want  any problems with italians 

        </P>
        <li> burgers </li>
        <P> you already knew this was going to be on the list don't lie to yourself
            , for me the best burger is a beef burger don't get me wrong i also like chicken burgers
            but meat, it  just hits diffrent that tendernes that juiciness it's  almost unmatched .
        </P>
        <li> fried chciken </li>
        <p> and finally the king of fast food fried chicken ,
            i mean do i have to even explain why this is here ?
            the sound when you bite into it that crunch is alone enough .
